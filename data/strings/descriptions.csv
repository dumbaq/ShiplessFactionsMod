ahegemony,FACTION,"The military group of deserters and renegades. There are a vast amount of former high-ranked Hegemony's military officers who are disillusioned with it's methods. United into a single faction, the rebels stole division of the Hegemony's flotilla and layed down on the distant planets of the sector. While gathering under their flag soldiers of fortune, mercenaries, they kindle the flames of revolution in the border territories of The Hegemony. Yet, while seeking for vengeance and justice they lost their own ways. As for now Antigemony Guerrilla represents totally decentralized extremist movement. They are stalwart veterans of numerous battles and value their allies above all else, but their approach becomes more and more terroristic over time.",,,
vikings,FACTION,"Predatory faction that splintered from main military forces of Tri-Tachyon megacorporation. Their captains call themselves the noble ancestors of long forgotten civilization of maritime plunderers and marauders. Their hierarchy grows as more and more dismissed Tri-Tachyon's clerks and fugitive corporats seek shelter, because retire from Tri-Tachyon is tantamount to death. The traditions of the Valhalla Wolves scorn any peaceful solutions and are driven by an insatiable thirst for freedom and battle. However, they can't be treated as flimsy pirates, as they are much more powerful and organised. Equipped with advanced Tri-Tachyon devices, their fleets strike with thousands of fighter wings piloted by their ferocious warriors slaughtering any weak in their path.",,,
